# TSDAE (Transformer-based Sequential Denoising AutoEncoder) configuration

model_name: "tsdae"

# TSDAE specific settings
tsdae:
  deletion_probability: 0.6 # Probability of deleting each token
  min_tokens_kept: 5 # Minimum tokens to keep after deletion

  # Decoder settings
  tie_encoder_decoder: true # Share weights between encoder and decoder

training:
  batch_size: 32
  num_epochs: 5
  learning_rate_backbone: 5.0e-5 # Higher for reconstruction task learning
  learning_rate_head: 2.0e-4 # Higher for decoder to learn denoising faster
  warmup_steps: 500
  weight_decay: 0.01
  gradient_clip: 1.0
  use_amp: true

  # TSDAE uses reconstruction loss, not contrastive
  loss_type: "cross_entropy"
